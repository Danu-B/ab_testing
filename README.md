# ab_testing

This repository is used for week 2 challenge. The instructions for this project can be found in the challenge document. The objective of this project is to determine if the creative ad designed by SmartAd had a better impact on brand awareness than a dummy ad.

After EDA(notebooks/data_exploration), We have used two approaches to test in this repository.

Classical AB test (notebooks/classical_ab_testing),
Sequential AB test (notebooks/sequential_ab_test)
